## Course Introduction
```
Hi. My name is Chuck Cobb. I assume that you already have taken my previous courses that are prerequisite for this course and you know who I am, so I won't go through an introduction of myself again. Welcome to my training course on Understanding. Agile at a Deeper Level. This course is designed for business people who play a leadership role in an agile project, either as a product owner, a business sponsor, or a business analyst. A frequent problem with many agile projects is that many Agile teams do not take the time to do the depth of understanding that's really needed to fully understand Agile. The training for many typical Agile teams is very limited, and it only goes into the mechanics of how to do Agile. To really take an adaptive approach with an agile project, you really need to understand in much more depth the principles and values behind Agile, and that is exactly what this course is designed to teach you. This course is part of an overall curriculum for Agile Business Management that consists of three learning paths You should've already completed the Introduction to Agile Business Management learning path, which is a prerequisite for this course. This course is the first course in the Mastering Agile Business Management learning path. It is designed to provide a much deeper understanding of how to effectively lead Agile and Scrum projects for anyone in a product owner or in an equivalent level of business responsibility. The third and final learning path is called Enterpriseâ€‘level Agile Business Management and is focused on advanced topics related to applying Agile to a business at an enterprise level. We're going to start this module with a brief introduction to the course. This course is the first of four courses in the Mastering Agile Business Management learning path that are shown here. There are three other courses that are required to complete this learning path. Here's an overview of the modules in this course. After this brief introduction, we're going to start with a module on Agile Manifesto Values and Principles. Then, we're going to do a module on learning to see the big picture and design thinking, as well as a module on Managing Flow in Agile Projects. And finally, we're going to wrap up with a summary of the course. In the first module of this course, we're going to discuss the Agile Manifesto values and principles. The proliferation of many Agile methodologies in the 1980's and the 1990's led to the Agile Manifesto, which was originally written in February of 2001 at the Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah. The Agile Manifesto was a very important milestone in synthesizing the underlying values and principles behind many of the diverse range of Agile methodologies that had developed up until that point in time. The original Agile Manifesto values and principles were written around a software development environment, but they are really much more general than that and can be applied to some extent to almost any kind of project. For traditional project managers, it forces us to think outside of the box that there are different ways of managing a project and you have to tailor the approach to the project. When we discuss the Agile Manifesto and the principles behind it, we will talk about it primarily from the perspective of a software development project, but that is not meant to indicate that it is limited to software development only. Here's a summary of the topics we're going to talk about in this module. We're going to discuss the Agile Manifesto values in the first lesson, then we're going to spend four lessons discussing the Agile Manifesto principles.
