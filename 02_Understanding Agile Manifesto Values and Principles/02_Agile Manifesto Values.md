## Agile Manifesto Values
```
The first lesson in this module is on the Agile Manifesto values. The four key values are as follows, individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. We will discuss each of these individually in the following slides. I want to emphasize, again, that it is very important to recognize that all of these statements are intended to be relative statements and not absolutes. For example, individuals and interactions over processes and tools does not mean that there are no processes and tools in an agile project. It means that the project relies more heavily on individual interactions to be more adaptive rather than being bound by a rigidly‑defined process and tools. Let me explain the concept of individuals and interactions over processes and tools a little further. In many traditional plan‑driven processes like the Waterfall approach, the emphasis on control required people to follow a well‑defined process. A more adaptive process requires you to control the process rather than the process controlling you. This kind of atmosphere is particularly important in an environment that requires creativity and innovation. This statement is essentially a response to the command and control project management practices that have been perceived as very impersonal and insensitive to people and rigidly‑ defined processes where the process manages you. From a project management perspective, it calls for a softer leadership approach with an emphasis on empowering people to do their jobs rather than a rigid, control‑oriented management approach that is highly directive, as well as flexible and adaptive processes. The last part of this statement regarding processes and tools might imply that there is no place in an agile project for processes and tools, but that is certainly not the case. Agile does use very well‑defined processes like Scrum, but they are meant to be interpreted and implemented intelligently by people rather than following them rigidly and mechanically. Tools can play a supporting role, but the important thing is to keep the tools in the right context. They should be there to leverage and facilitate human interactions, not to replace them. The important point is that agile processes depend very heavily on empowered people making intelligent decisions and the power of collaborative teamwork. In a similar way, working software over comprehensive documentation does not mean that there is no documentation at all in an agile project. Many traditional plan‑driven projects, and in particular, the Waterfall process, can be very documentation intensive. For example, in a true Waterfall process, documentation is a required deliverable at the end of each phase to show that you have successfully completed the requirements of that phase. Documentation in an agile project should be used intelligently where it provides value, and documentation should never be an end in itself. Many times online electronic tools that are designed to facilitate collaboration and communication can take the place of hard copy documentation. This value statement indicates a preference for working software over comprehensive documentation. This statement is essentially a response to typical phase‑gate project management processes that call for extensive documentation deliverables at the end of each phase. There was entirely too much emphasis on producing documentation to the extent that the documentation took on a life of its own and there was insufficient emphasis on producing working software. One of the problems with documentation is that it can inhibit normal communication. The typical Waterfall project was heavily based on documentation. The project team would develop an elaborately detailed requirement specification, and the software was tested against meeting that specification. In many Waterfall projects, the end user doesn't even see what is being developed until the final user acceptance testing at the end of the project. There are lots of opportunities for problems with that approach. Many users have a difficult time defining detailed requirements up front in a project, especially in a very uncertain and changing environment. And relying too heavily on documentation can lead to significant miscommunications and misunderstandings about the intent of the requirements. It's important to note that this statement doesn't imply that there should be no documentation at all in an agile project. The key thing to recognize is that any documentation should provide value in some way. Documentation should never be an end in itself. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation does not mean that contracts are incompatible with an agile approach. Very few people get a blank check to do an agile project without any expectations of what the cost and schedule of the project will be. So there's generally some kind of a need for managing customer expectations about costs and schedules. In a traditional plan‑driven project, there is typically a contract wth the customer to deliver a solution that meets defined requirements within a given cost and schedule, and naturally, to achieve that objective, the requirements need to be relatively fixed. In an agile project, there is much more of a spirit of partnership between the customer and the project team. Both sides acknowledge that the requirements are somewhat uncertain and are likely to be at least somewhat redefined or clarified as the project progresses. And both sides work collaboratively in a spirit of partnership and trust to develop a solution and manage cost and schedule tradeoffs as the project progresses. Agile has been successfully used in a broad range of contracting situations from fixed price contracts where the requirements for the contract deliverables are fairly well defined to more loosely defined contracting situations where only the broad‑based contract objectives are defined. The important thing is that the flexibility in the contract should be consistent with the nature of the requirements, and both sides need to have a mutual understanding of the level of uncertainty in the requirements and how the contract will be managed. This value statement indicates a preference for customer collaboration over contract negotiation. The typical project prior to Agile has been sometimes based on an arm's length contracting approach. Project managers for many years have been measured on controlling costs and schedules, and doing that has required some form of contract to deliver something based on a defined specification, and that also requires some form of change control to limit changes in the requirements as the project progresses. Agile recognizes that, particularly in an uncertain environment, a more collaborative approach can be much more effective. Instead of having a strong, ironclad contract to deliver something based on some predefined requirements, it's better in some cases to create a general agreement based on some high‑level requirements and work out the details as the project is in progress. Naturally, that approach requires a spirit of trust and partnership between the project team and the end customer that the team will ultimately deliver what is required within a reasonable time and budget. Without that spirit of trust and partnership, it will be almost impossible to make this approach work. Again, it's important to recognize that these values are all relative, and you have to fit this statement to the situation. At one extreme, I have applied an approach to a government contracting environment. Naturally, we had to have a contract that called for deliverables, and milestones, and expected costs. But even in that environment, the government agency understood the value of collaboration over having originally defined arms length kind of contract, and we were able to find the right balance. At the other extreme, you might have a project where the requirements are very uncertain and a much more adaptive approach is needed to work collaboratively with a customer to define the requirements as the project progresses without much of a defined contract at all. Responding to change over following a plan does not mean that agile projects are totally unplanned. A traditional plan‑driven project attempts to develop a detailed plan for a project up front prior to the start of the project and attempts to control changes to that plan to manage the scope of the project as the project progresses. An example would be a construction project where there would be a fairly detailed plan for constructing a building prior to the start of the construction. An agile project doesn't attempt to do a detailed plan for the entire project up front prior to the start of the project. It uses more of a rolling wave planning process. Some level of planning is done up front based on the level of uncertainty in the project, but much of the detailed planning is deferred until later in the project when more and better information will be available to support those decisions. It's similar to the kind of planning you might do for taking a vacation. When you plan a vacation, you don't typically plan what you're going to do down to the last detail for every day that you're on vacation. You probably have at least some goals for the things you want to do that may or may not be rigid and cast in concrete, but there's typically some level of flexibility built into your plans to develop more detailed plans once you're on vacation and have a better idea of what you want to do. The key point is that agile projects are not totally unplanned. They use more of a rolling wave planning process where some level of planning is done upfront based on the level of uncertainty in the project. But much of the detailed planning is deferred until later in the project when more and better information will be available to make those decisions. This value statement indicates a preference for responding to change over following a plan. This statement is in response to many projects that have been oriented towards controlling costs and schedules and made it difficult for the customer to change the requirements in order to control the scope and, hence, the cost and schedule of the project. The problem in applying that approach to environments where the requirements for the project are uncertain and difficult to specify up front is that it forces a user to totally define the requirements for a project up front without even seeing what the final result is going to look like, and that's just not very realistic in many cases. In many situations, it is more effective to recognize that some level of requirements are going to change and evolve as the project progresses and design the project approach around that kind of change. It's important to recognize that this is not an all‑or‑nothing decision to have either completely undefined requirements or highly detailed requirements. There are a lot of alternatives between those two extremes, and you have to choose the right approach based on the nature of the project. All of these statements are somewhat interrelated, and you have to consider all of them in concert to design an approach that is appropriate for a particular project. From a project management perspective, it calls for some skill to be able to do that. Instead of force fitting a project to some kind of canned and well‑defined methodology like Waterfall, the project manager needs to intelligently developed an approach that is well suited to the project. That applies to any project, not just Agile.

## Notes
- Agile Manifesto values:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.
- Values are relative, not absolute.
- Emphasis on the importance of adaptability and flexibility in Agile.
- Agile values do not exclude processes and tools; they should support adaptability.
- Working software is prioritized over extensive documentation, but some documentation is acceptable when it provides value.
- Collaboration with the customer takes precedence over rigid contract negotiation.
- Agile projects involve a more collaborative and adaptable approach with customers.
- Responding to change does not mean a lack of planning but a rolling wave planning process.
- Agile projects adapt plans as more information becomes available.
- These values are interrelated and should be considered together to tailor an approach for a specific project.
