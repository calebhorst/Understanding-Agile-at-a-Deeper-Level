## Agile Manifesto Principles: Part 2
```
In this lesson, we're going to continue discussing the Agile Manifesto principles. This is part two of four parts on that topic. This slide shows a summary of the next three Agile Manifesto principles. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project, build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. And the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face‑to‑face conversation. We will discuss each of these principles in more detail in the following slides. The next principle emphasizes a partnership approach between the development team and the business sponsors. This is very consistent with the Agile Manifesto value of collaboration over contracts. To implement this principle, both the business sponsors and the project team need to feel jointly responsible for the successful completion of the project. This calls for a much higher level of engagement of the business sponsors than is commonly found in many traditional projects where the implementation of the project might be almost totally delegated to the project team. The degree of engagement, of course, should be appropriate to the nature of the project, and how the business sponsors get engaged might be different depending on the circumstances. For example, Scrum has a role called the product owner that provides a day‑to‑day business direction for the project. But the direction may not be limited to that. In a large enterprise‑level project, there might be a number of other stakeholders that need to provide input and be engaged somehow. Designing an approach that gets the right people engaged at the right time is very important for making the project successful. The next principle emphasizes the importance of properly motivated individuals on a project. Too often in the past, some project managers have used high pressure command and control tactics to pressure project teams into delivering results faster. Many of us have been involved in what I call death march projects where people are given an absolute deadline for getting something done and have to work nights and weekends, if necessary, to get it done. There are also some projects that are run like a sweatshop that are very insensitive to people, and when you're in an environment that requires high levels of creativity and innovation, that approach just doesn't work very well. The philosophy of Agile is based on a high level of empowerment and individual initiative by the people in the project. Instead of being told specifically what to do and being pressured into doing it, Agile teams are given general direction and are expected to figure out how to get it done most effectively and efficiently themselves. Making that kind of approach work requires a very people‑oriented leadership style. However, it doesn't mean that there is no need for leadership whatsoever. As an Agile project manager, you need to adapt your leadership style to fit the situation, and that will typically depend on several factors, including the nature of the project and the level of maturity and experience of the team. The next principle emphasizes face‑to‑face communication. This is another statement that you have to not take as an absolute, but think of it as a relative. It is not always possible with distributed teams to always have face‑to‑face communications, but it is certainly desirable if it is possible. This statement also doesn't mean that the only form of communication is direct face‑to‑face communication. It is a reaction to the history of Waterfall projects that heavily relied on documented requirements as a way of communications. There are many ways to communicate information in various forms, and you need to choose the optimum mix to fit a given situation. The right mix will depend on a number of factors, including the scope and complexity of the project and the distribution of the team working on the project.

## Notes
- Agile Manifesto principles (continued):
  - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    - Promotes a partnership approach between the development team and business sponsors.
    - Encourages joint responsibility for project success.
    - Calls for an appropriate level of engagement from business sponsors.
  - Build projects around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    - Rejects high-pressure, command-and-control tactics.
    - Emphasizes empowerment and individual initiative.
    - Highlights the importance of a people-oriented leadership style.
    - Leadership style should adapt to the project's nature, team maturity, and other factors.
  - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    - Recognizes the value of face-to-face communication while allowing for flexibility in communication methods.
    - Responds to the heavy reliance on documented requirements in Waterfall projects.
    - Encourages selecting the right mix of communication methods based on project factors.

- These principles advocate for collaboration, motivation, and effective communication in Agile projects, and they should be adapted to suit the specific project's context and requirements.
