## Agile Manifesto Principles: Part 3
```
In this lesson, we're going to continue discussing the Agile Manifesto principles. This is part three of four parts. This slide shows the next three Agile Manifesto principles. Working software is the primary measure of progress. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely, and continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. We will discuss each of these principles in more detail in the following slides. The next principle emphasizes working software as the primary measure of progress. Measuring progress on a software development project can be difficult and problematic. The traditional method is to break a project into tasks and track the percent completion of those tasks as a way of measuring progress. However, that can be very misleading because often the list of tasks is incomplete, and the level of completion often require some subjective judgment, which is difficult to make and often inaccurate. Testing is another factor in this. Very often in the past, the entire development process and testing process might've been sequential. The result is that even though the development of the software might've seemed to be complete, you don't know how complete it really is until it has been tested and validated to be complete. An agile approach emphasizes doing testing much more concurrently as the software is developed. There is a concept in Agile called the definition of done that you will hear quite often that says you have to clearly define what done means, and it generally means that the software has been tested and accepted by the user. In other environments, the definition of done might be a lot more ambiguous and subject to interpretation. If you don't have a clear definition of done, any estimate of percent complete is likely to be suspect. The key point is that a more accurate measure of progress is to break up a software project into chunks of functionality where each chunk of software can be demonstrated to the user for feedback and acceptance, and each chunk of software is not deemed to be complete until it fully meets the definition of done. The next principle emphasizes maintaining a pace that supports sustainable development. Many of the underpinnings of Agile come from lean manufacturing and total quality management, which was discussed in the last module. In a manufacturing environment, companies learned many years ago that running a manufacturing plant like a sweatshop and forcing workers to work an excessive number of hours under poor conditions does not often result in high quality products. A similar thing is especially true in a natural environment because the success of the effort is so critically dependent on the creativity and motivation of the team. In that kind of situation, it is even more important to create an environment where work is sustainable over a long period of time. The next statement is that continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Many people might have the image of an agile software development team as a bunch of cowboys that just get together and hammer out code without much design planning and without any coding standards. That is not the case. Agile recognizes the need for doing things the right way to avoid unnecessary rework later. On the other hand, an agile approach should not result in over designing or gold plating a product either. A comment you will hear often in an agile environment is a concept of just barely good enough. In other words, the work should be done to a sufficient level of completeness and quality to fulfill the purpose it was intended to fill and nothing more. Going beyond that level of just barely good enough is considered waste.

## Notes
- Agile Manifesto principles (continued):
  - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    - Challenges traditional methods of measuring project progress based on task completion.
    - Emphasizes demonstrating chunks of fully tested and accepted software to users.
    - Promotes having a clear "definition of done" for each piece of software.
  - Agile processes promote sustainable development.
    - Draws from lean manufacturing and total quality management principles.
    - Rejects excessive work hours and poor working conditions in favor of sustainable work.
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    - Counters the misconception of agile as being undisciplined or hasty.
    - Advocates doing things right without over-designing or gold plating.
    - Encourages a "just barely good enough" approach to avoid waste.

- These principles reinforce the importance of producing working software, sustainable development practices, and maintaining technical excellence and good design in Agile projects. They aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of software development while avoiding unnecessary rework.
