## Agile Manifesto Principles: Part 4
```
In this lesson, we're going to continue discussing the Agile Manifesto principles. This is part four of four parts on that topic. This slide shows the final three Agile Manifesto principles. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self‑organizing teams. And at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. We will discuss each of these principles in more detail in the following slides. The next statement emphasizes simplicity. How many times have we seen projects go out of control because the requirements get much too complex and very difficult to implement? Some people call that gold plating. This is also related to the concept of just barely good enough. Don't over design something. Keep it as simple as possible. In some cases, it may make sense to start with something really simple, see if it fills a need, and then expand the functionality later only if necessary. Another concept in Agile is called the minimum viable product, which defines a minimum set of functional features a product has to have to be viable at all in the marketplace. It's generally much more effective to take an incremental approach to start with something simple and then expand it as necessary rather than starting with something overly complex that might be overkill for the requirement. The next principle is that the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self‑organizing teams. Agile is heavily based on the idea of self‑organizing teams, but that needs some interpretation. Sometimes developers have used the idea of self‑organizing as an excuse for anarchy, but that's not what was intended. The intent is that if you have the right people on a team and the team is empowered to collectively use all the skills on the team in a collaborative manner, that it will generally deliver a much better result than a single individual could deliver acting alone. The idea is that high performance, cross‑functional teams that work collaboratively can produce superior results. This is especially true for developing more complex products that require integrating multiple perspectives to optimize the design of the product that is being produced. The last principle is that at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. As I've previously mentioned, Agile is based heavily on continuous improvement and using short intervals to reflect on what's working and what's not working and taking quick corrective action as necessary. In Scrum, this is called a retrospective, and it happens at the end of each sprint. A focus on continuous improvement is essential to a highly adaptive empirical development process. In Scrum, the process is designed to continuously improve the product that is being produced, as well as a process that is used to produce a product throughout the project. In the next lesson, we're going to start a new module on learning to see the big picture, and the first lesson in that module is on systems thinking.

## Notes
- Agile Manifesto principles (continued):
  - Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
    - Advocates keeping requirements and designs as simple as possible.
    - Encourages starting with a minimum viable product and incrementally expanding as needed.
  - The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self‑organizing teams.
    - Emphasizes the importance of self‑organizing teams that work collaboratively.
    - Believes that diverse teams can deliver superior results through collective efforts.
  - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
    - Highlights the significance of continuous improvement through reflection and adjustment.
    - In Scrum, this is known as a retrospective and occurs at the end of each sprint.

- These principles reinforce the value of simplicity, self-organizing teams, and continuous improvement in Agile practices. They aim to streamline development efforts, leverage team expertise, and promote ongoing enhancement of both the product and the development process.
