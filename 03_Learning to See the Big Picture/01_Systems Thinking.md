## Systems Thinking
```
Hi. In this lesson, we're going to start a new module on learning to see the big picture. Here's a brief outline of the topics we're going to cover in this section. The first topic is systems thinking, which is critical to see the interrelationship of processes, people, and tools from an overall systems perspective. The next topic is complex adaptive systems, which is based on understanding how systems naturally occur in nature that have adaptive properties similar to Agile. In this section, we're going to discuss systems thinking, which is a very important concept to understand in order to develop an adaptive agile mindset rather than doing Agile mechanically. To do that, it is essential to understand Agile in a larger and much more dynamic context of how it integrates into the overall business system that it supports, and that requires a systems thinking approach. Many traditional plan‑driven project management approaches, like the Waterfall approach, are fairly static and well defined. The process doesn't change significantly from one project to the next. An agile project, by its very nature, has to be much more dynamic and adaptive to fit a given situation. That's much more complex than simply executing a static and well‑defined process. It requires a different way of thinking to consider all the elements that might impact the process and how to dynamically adapt a process to fit a given situation. That's where systems thinking comes in. It's a very different way of thinking that is essential to adopting an agile mindset. Here's the definition of systems thinking. Systems thinking utilizes habits, tools, and concepts to develop an understanding of the interdependent structures of dynamic systems. When individuals have a better understanding of systems, they are better able to identify the leverage points that lead to desired outcomes. The practice of systems thinking can be complex. The phrase systems thinking can refer to a set of tools such as causal loop diagram, stock and flow diagrams, and simulation models to help us map and explore dynamic complexity. For example, systems thinkers often describe the world in terms of reinforcing and balancing processes, limits, delays, patterns of behavior over time, and so forth. However, without adding a lot of complexity, a lot can be gained from simply developing a unique perspective on reality, a perspective that sharpens our awareness of the whole, and how the parts within those wholes interrelate. Here's a couple of definitions that reflect that. Systems thinking is a vantage point from which you see a whole, a web of relationships, rather than focusing on the detail of any particular piece. Events are seen in the larger context of a pattern that is unfolding over time. Systems thinking is also a perspective of seeing and understanding systems as wholes rather than as a collection of parts. A whole is a web of interconnections that creates emerging patterns. That's the way we're going to use the term systems thinking in this course. As it relates to Agile, it means being able to see a complex agile process as a dynamic organism that has many elements with cause and effect relationships rather than seeing it as a more static mechanical process and also seeing it in the context of how it fits within the overall business system that it is part of, rather than seeing it as simply as standalone development process. Systems thinking, in many cases, involves developing a mental model of how a complex system works. Here's an example to illustrate this idea from a business perspective. When someone thinks of a business that they are part of, many times they will think of the business in terms of an organization structure that looks something like this. This is a somewhat static and not very dynamic view of how a business works. As an alternative, this slide shows a simple, but much more dynamic enterprise model of how a business works that I used in the first book I published in 2003 that is designed to provide a framework for applying process improvement initiatives to enterprise‑level business situations. This model is fairly simple, but it does provide a useful model to understand the cause and effect relationships that drive business results. It's very common that when a company's business results don't turn out to be what was expected, that the company becomes very reactive in trying to fix the problem. However, without a clear idea of what factors influence business results, it may not be very clear of what needs to be fixed. Having a model like this allows a much more proactive approach. Instead of reacting to changes in business results, a company can become much more proactive in addressing the factors that influence the business results long before the impact might be visible in terms of actual results. There are several levels in this model that have cause and effect relationships to make the business operate as a dynamic overall system. At the bottom level are such fundamental things as employee knowledge and skills, supporting systems, and other enablers and constraints that all have a significant impact on influencing operational process performance. Operational process performance, if it is designed correctly, in turn, plays an important role in driving customer value. And finally, customer value relative to the competition plays a big role in driving business results. Binary thinking is the antithesis of systems thinking. Many people use what I call binary thinking to simplify what is actually not very simple at all. For example, you will hear a lot of people talk about comparing Agile to Waterfall as if it were a simple binary choice between the two. If you think about it, it is much more complicated than that. There are many variations on what Agile is. Although Scrum is very widely used, it is only one of those variants, and I don't believe very many people use a full‑blown Waterfall approach anymore. People have been using innovative approaches for a number of years prior to Agile. It's not really a simple binary choice between those two alternatives, and there are many ways to blend Agile and traditional project management principles and practices together in the right proportions to fit a given situation. But it requires a deeper understanding to do that. You have to understand a broader range of methodologies and understand the principles behind those methodologies to know how to mix and match them together. That's another example of systems thinking. Many people choose to ignore complexity and oversimplify it. There's an old saying that says it's easier to accept a simple myth in some situations than it is to understand and accept complex reality. Many people oversimplify what isn't so simple at all, and the result can be very misleading. Binary thinking is often based on what is called a false dichotomy. A dichotomy is a set of two mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive alternatives. A false dichotomy is a dichotomy that is not jointly exhaustive. In other words, there are other alternatives or that is not mutually exclusive. In other words, the alternatives can overlap, or that is possibly neither. Here's an example of a false dichotomy. If you want better schools, you have to raise taxes. If you don't want to raise taxes, you can't have better schools. A third alternative is that you could spend the existing tax money much more efficiently. The typical Agile versus Waterfall argument is a perfect example of a false dichotomy. When you look at Agile versus Waterfall from a systems thinking perspective rather than from a binary thinking perspective, you realize that it is much more complicated than a binary and mutually exclusive choice between two extremes. Here's a diagram that shows the complexity behind the Agile versus Waterfall comparison. Suppose you had to choose between an agile project management approach or a more traditional project management approach. What are the factors that you would consider and how are they interrelated? This diagram shows a few of the things you might consider. A key factor is going to be what planning approach you use for the project. Will it be heavily based on upfront planning, or will it be more based on deferred planning until later in the project? That is a function of a number of things, including the level of uncertainty in the project. But it is also directly related to the approach for managing risks in the project, which is also related to the level of criticality in the project. Another factor is the testing and support considerations, which is also impacted by the project risk and criticality, as well as the scope and complexity of the project. Finally, the organizational culture and organizational capabilities are a very significant factor that would influence whether you would choose an agile or a more traditional project management approach. In summary, systems thinking is an alternative to binary thinking. It involves seeing things in a very different perspective based on the relationships among a system's parts. It is applicable to a very wide range of complex processes and systems. Systems thinking is a way of understanding reality that emphasizes the relationships among the systems parts rather than the parts themselves. Systems thinking doesn't come naturally to many people. The human mind is not naturally programmed to think in systems. It does not naturally think non linearly. From an early age, we learn to think in simple terms of cause and effect and to speak a language rooted in linear cause and effect concepts. In addition, we expect the effect to happen immediately after the cause so that they can be easily associated. Systems thinking is complex. Cause and effect thinking is simple, even a seven‑month old can do it. Systems thinking must be taught rather than learned naturally. Humans are not programmed to easily comprehend effects that are delayed from or several derivatives from the original cause. The key point is that you shouldn't just accept things at their simple face value and mechanically follow a process without questioning why it is done that way and what factors might cause it to work or not work and without determining if there's a better way to accomplish the same result.

## Notes
- Systems thinking is a crucial concept in understanding how Agile integrates into the larger business system, emphasizing the interrelationships of processes, people, and tools.
- It allows for a dynamic and adaptive approach, which is essential in Agile, as opposed to the static and well-defined nature of traditional project management methods like Waterfall.
- Systems thinking sees a complex Agile process as a dynamic organism with cause-and-effect relationships and places it within the context of the overall business system.
- Developing a mental model of how complex systems work is a key aspect of systems thinking.
- It's important to avoid binary thinking, which oversimplifies complex situations, and instead embrace a systems thinking perspective to explore the nuances and relationships between various factors.
- Systems thinking is complex and may not come naturally to everyone, as humans tend to think in linear, cause-and-effect terms. It must be taught and practiced.

Systems thinking encourages questioning and a deeper understanding of processes, aiming to find better ways of achieving desired results.
