## Complex Adaptive Systems
```
An empirical process control model is an example of a complex adaptive system, which is the subject we're going to talk about next. An understanding of complex adaptive systems is important because it fundamentally defines a process of how an agile approach works. And, by the way, you're likely to find a question on the PMI‑ACP exam on complex adaptive systems. This slide shows a definition of a complex adaptive system. A complex adaptive system is, "a complex macroscopic collection of relatively similar and partially connected micro‑structures formed in order to adapt to a changing environment and to increase its survivability as a macro‑structure." Examples of complex adaptive systems are found all around us in nature. One example I can think of is an ant hill. There are thousands, perhaps millions, of ants required to build a large ant hill. I'm guessing that they don't start out with a grand plan of what the finished ant hill is going to look like. It just evolves. And somehow those thousands or millions of ants all work collaboratively together as a self‑organizing team without a lot of direction. And when the ant hill is finished, it may not be a perfect‑looking structure, but it satisfies the purpose it was intended for, and it will evolve as needed to fit the overall environment that it is part of. Peter Fryer has developed an excellent explanation of how complex adaptive systems have evolved. "For many years scientists saw the universe as a linear place, one where simple rules of cause and effect apply." They viewed the universe as a big machine and thought if they took the machine apart and understood the parts, then they would understand the whole. They also thought that the universe's components could be viewed as machines, believing that if we worked on the parts of these machines and made each part work better, then the whole world would work better. "Scientists believed that the universe and everything in it could be predicted and controlled. However hard they tried to find the missing components to complete the picture, they failed." Despite using the most powerful computers in the world, the weather remained unpredictable. Despite intensive study and analysis of ecosystems, an immune system did not behave as expected. But it was in the world of quantum physics that the strangest discoveries were being made, and it was apparent that the very smallest subnuclear particles were behaving according to a very different set of rules of cause and effect. Gradually, as scientists of all disciplines began exploring these phenomenon, a new theory emerged, complexity theory, a theory based on relationships, emergence, patterns, and iterations, a theory that maintains that the universe is full of systems, weather systems, immune systems, social systems, etc., and that these systems are complex and constantly adapting to their environment. Hence, complex adaptive systems. The important point is that complex adaptive systems have been found in many natural environments since the beginning of time. What has evolved is not the systems themselves but our understanding of them. We need to adopt a similar thinking approach to project management. Instead of thinking of projects as a linear place where simple rules of cause and effect apply, we need to think of it as a much more dynamic organism. If it is done correctly, a complex adaptive system's approach is a very powerful approach to project management. It's like the ant hill example. I suspect that there aren't designated project managers among the ants building the ant hill to plan and delegate the work to individual ants. The individual ants somehow just work together naturally and collaboratively to build the ant hill without a lot of explicit direction. That's exactly the way an agile project works. If it is done right, an agile team doesn't need a lot of explicit direction to be told exactly what to do and how to do it. With some very general direction, they should be able to figure out what needs to be done to accomplish the goals that have been established. Peter Fryer has also provided a simple diagram that explains how a complex adaptive system works. The agents in the system are all the components of that system. In the ant hill example, the agents are the ants. Here's a few other examples of complex adaptive systems, the air and water molecules in a weather system and the flora and fauna in an ecosystem. These agents interact and connect with each other in unpredictable and unplanned ways. From this massive interaction, regularities emerge and start to form a pattern, which feeds back on the system and informs the interactions of the agents. For example, in an ecosystem, if a virus starts to deplete one species, this results in a greater or lesser food supply for the others in the system, which affects their behavior and their numbers. A period of flux occurs in all the populations in the system until a new balance is established. Here are some properties of complex adaptive systems that Peter Fryer has identified. The first is emergence. Rather than being planned or controlled, the agents in the system interact in apparently random ways. From all these interactions, patterns emerge, which informs the behavior of the agents within the system and the behavior of the system itself. The ant hill is a great analogy for how a pure, agile project might evolve. The next is co‑evolution. All systems exist within their own environment, and they are also part of that environment. Therefore, as their environment changes, they need to change to ensure best fit. But because they are part of the environment, when they change, they change their environment, and as it has changed, they need to change again. And so it goes on as a constant process. This characteristic is also applicable to an agile process. An agile project management process is part of a much larger business ecosystem and needs to adapt and evolve as that business system evolves. The key point is that we need to recognize the dynamic nature of complex adaptive systems in our projects and also recognise that those systems need to evolve as needed to fit the environments that they're part of. Many traditional plan‑driven projects fail to recognize and take advantage of the dynamic nature of project teams that are part of the project, and as a result, fail to utilize the full power of the teams. Many agile teams focus on optimizing the performance of a team from a development perspective only and fail to recognize the need to adapt a system to the overall business ecosystem that the development project is part of. Complex systems are also suboptimal. A complex system does not have to be perfect in order for it to thrive within its environment. It only has to be slightly better than its competitors, and any energy used on being better than that is wasted energy. A complex adaptive system, once it has reached the state of being good enough, will trade off increased efficiency every time in favor of greater effectiveness. This is also true of an agile process. An agile process is based on the understanding that absolute perfection is not necessarily the most appropriate goal. Ideally, an agile process seeks to meet the requirements for a product in terms of minimal, marketable features, and only going beyond that level if it provides business value. Ideally, complex adaptive systems also have what is called requisite variety. The greater the variety within the system, the stronger it is. In fact, ambiguity and paradox abound in complex adaptive systems, which use contradictions to create new possibilities to co‑evolve with their environment. Democracy is a good example in that its strength is derived from its tolerance and even insistence in a variety of political perspectives. Here's how this applies to agile. A strong agile team is able to successfully integrate people of different perspectives into a very cohesive, cross‑functional team. A team of yes‑men that all think alike is typically not that strong. Another important property of a complex adaptive system is connectivity. The ways in which the agents in a system connect and relate to one another is critical to the survival of the system because it is from these connections that the patterns are formed and that the feedback is disseminated. In relationship to an agile process, this is extremely important. The agents in an agile process are the people on the team, as well as the outside stakeholders who interact with the team. The success of the process is critically dependent on the relationships and interactions among all these people. Ideally, those interrelationships are very dynamic and based on simple rules without being overly controlled or structured. The next property is that complex systems have simple rules. Complex adaptive systems are really not that complicated. The emerging patterns may have a rich variety, but like a kaleidoscope, the rules governing the function of the system are quite simple. A classic example is that all water systems in the world, all the streams, rivers, lakes, oceans, waterfalls, etc., with their infinite beauty, power, and variety are governed by the simple principle that water finds its own level. Complex adaptive systems are also based on an iterative process. Small changes in the initial conditions of the system can have significant effects after they have passed through the emergence and feedback loop a few times, often referred to as the butterfly effect. A rolling snowball, for example, gains on each roll much more snow than it did on the previous roll. And very soon, a fist‑sized snowball becomes a giant one. Complex adaptive systems are also self‑organizing. There is no hierarchy of command and control in a complex, adaptive system. There is not much planning or managing. But there is a constant reorganizing to find the best fit with the environment. A classic example is that if one were to take any typical town and add up all the food in the shops and divide by the number of people in the town, there will likely be only about two weeks of food supply. But there is no food plan, food manager, or any other formal controlling process. The system is continually self‑organizing through the process of emergence and feedback. Both an iterative development approach, as well as an emphasis on self‑organizing teams, are extremely critical for successful agile projects. Complexity theory is not the same as chaos theory, which is derived from mathematics. But chaos does have a place in complexity theory in that systems exist on a spectrum ranging from equilibrium to chaos. A system in equilibrium does not have the internal dynamics to enable it to respond to its environment and will slowly or quickly die. A system in chaos ceases to function as a system. The most productive state to be in is at the edge of chaos, where there is maximum variety and creativity leading to new possibilities. This slide shows how that concept relates to the Stacey complexity model that was previously discussed. A process that operates near the edge of chaos might be ideal, but there's a risk of it straying over the line into chaos and losing its effectiveness altogether. On the other hand, a system that is in equilibrium may not be responsive at all to changing conditions and for that reason may not be effective. This is a delicate balancing act to choose the appropriate balance. The key point is that in a highly uncertain environment, an adaptive approach that encourages individual creativity is essential, and over‑emphasis on control and predictability can stifle the adaptivity and creativity that might be needed to deal with a highly uncertain environment. The final characteristic of complex adaptive systems is that most systems are nested within other systems, and many systems are systems of smaller systems. If we take the example of a food shop, the food shop itself is a system with its staff, customers, suppliers, and neighbors. It also belongs to the food system of that town and the larger food system of that country. It belongs to the retail system locally and nationally and the economic system locally and nationally and probably many more. Therefore, it is part of many different systems, most of which are themselves part of other systems. A key point is that "it is important to optimize the performance of a project team within the broader context of the business ecosystem that it is part of rather than within a narrow project development context." In the next lesson, we're going to start a new module on design thinking. And the first lesson in that module is What is Design Thinking?

## Notes
- Complex adaptive systems are collections of micro-structures that adapt to changing environments to increase their survivability. They can be seen in various natural phenomena.
- In a complex adaptive system, interactions between micro-structures result in patterns and behaviors that emerge over time.
- An example of a complex adaptive system is an ant hill, where individual ants work together without explicit direction to build a structure that evolves as needed.
- Complex adaptive systems have properties such as emergence (patterns emerging from random interactions), co-evolution (systems evolving with their environment), requisite variety (the strength of a system is derived from its variety), connectivity (interactions and relationships among agents), simple rules governing the system, an iterative process, self-organization, and a balance between equilibrium and chaos.
- An agile project can be seen as a complex adaptive system where teams self-organize and adapt to changing requirements and environmental factors.
- Systems within systems (nesting) is a common feature in complex adaptive systems, and it's important to optimize a project team's performance within the broader context of the business ecosystem it's part of.
- Complex adaptive systems are valuable for managing projects in highly uncertain environments and promoting creativity and adaptability.
- The edge of chaos, where a system has maximum variety and creativity, is often the most productive state for complex adaptive systems.

Understanding complex adaptive systems is important for applying an agile approach to project management effectively and navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.
