## What Is Design Thinking?
```
Hi, and welcome to the next module in this course .In this module, we're going to discuss design thinking. Design thinking is a relatively new concept that puts an emphasis on user‑oriented design, which has a high priority on developing products that are very well designed to satisfy user needs. It is very consistent with an agile approach. Here's a brief summary of the topics we will talk about in this module. We're going to start with a discussion of what is design thinking? Then we're going to talk about the stages of the design thinking model. Next, we're going to discuss how does design thinking relate to agile. Then we're going to discuss some successful examples of design thinking. And finally, we're going to do a summary of design thinking. The first lesson in this section is on what is design thinking? There are many different definitions of design thinking. I've developed a simplified definition of my own that is shown here. Design thinking is a way of thinking that emphasizes a disciplined and methodical approach for problem solving, combined with creativity and innovation throughout the product life cycle to develop highly competitive, leading‑edge products. The general problem that design thinking addresses is that many people have a tendency to jump too quickly into a technical design solution before thoroughly understanding all aspects of the problem to be solved and before evaluating alternative solutions to determine an optimum design. Design thinking can be critical for companies to develop a competitive advantage, where product leadership is an important factor. It is especially useful for very difficult design problems, which are ill‑defined or tricky. One of the most critical aspects of design thinking is an emphasis on human engineering. "Design thinking has a human‑centered core. It encourages organizations to focus on the people they're creating for, which leads to better products, services, and internal processes." When you sit down to create a solution for a business need, the first question should always be, what's the human need behind it? "In employing design thinking, you're pulling together what's desirable from a human point of view with what is technologically feasible and what is economically viable." It also allows those who aren't trained as designers to use creative tools to address a vast range of challenges. The process starts with taking action and understanding the right questions. It involves embracing simple mindset shifts and tackling problems from a new direction. Design thinking means paying attention to customer needs and preferences, rather than simply optimizing a design from a technical or manufacturing process perspective. Here's an example. PepsiCo has used design thinking to improve many of its products. Sun Chips is an example. The original size was 1 inch by 1 inch. When you'd bite into a chip, it would break into pieces. In focus groups, consumers told PepsiCo they went to another product because it was bite sized. PepsiCo had to conclude that Sun Chips were too big. It doesn't matter that the molds can only cut 1 inch by 1 inch. PepsiCo does not sell products based on the manufacturing processes they have, but on how target customers can fall in love with them. Design thinking seeks to maximize innovation. However, innovation is multi‑dimensional. Many times a design is limited to looking at technological feasibility and business viability. However, human values are often overlooked. Design thinking seeks to maximize overall innovation in all of these areas.

## Notes
- Complex adaptive systems are collections of micro-structures that adapt to changing environments to increase their survivability. They can be seen in various natural phenomena.
- In a complex adaptive system, interactions between micro-structures result in patterns and behaviors that emerge over time.
- An example of a complex adaptive system is an ant hill, where individual ants work together without explicit direction to build a structure that evolves as needed.
- Complex adaptive systems have properties such as emergence (patterns emerging from random interactions), co-evolution (systems evolving with their environment), requisite variety (the strength of a system is derived from its variety), connectivity (interactions and relationships among agents), simple rules governing the system, an iterative process, self-organization, and a balance between equilibrium and chaos.
- An agile project can be seen as a complex adaptive system where teams self-organize and adapt to changing requirements and environmental factors.
- Systems within systems (nesting) is a common feature in complex adaptive systems, and it's important to optimize a project team's performance within the broader context of the business ecosystem it's part of.
- Complex adaptive systems are valuable for managing projects in highly uncertain environments and promoting creativity and adaptability.
- The edge of chaos, where a system has maximum variety and creativity, is often the most productive state for complex adaptive systems.

Understanding complex adaptive systems is important for applying an agile approach to project management effectively and navigating the complexities of dynamic environments.
