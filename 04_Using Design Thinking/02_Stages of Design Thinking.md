## Stages of Design Thinking
```
In this lesson, we're going to talk more about the Stages of Design Thinking. This slide shows the five generally accepted stages associated with Design Thinking. We will talk about each of these in more detail in the following slides. However, I want to emphasize that this is just a conceptual model and it is not intended that Design Thinking always rigidly follows these stages. The first stage of the Design Thinking process is to gain an empathetic understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. This involves consulting experts to find out more about the area of concern through observing, engaging, and empathizing with people to understand their experiences and motivation, as well as immersing yourself in the physical environment so that you can gain a deeper understanding of the issues involved. Empathy is crucial to a human‑centered design process such as Design Thinking, and empathy allows design thinkers to set aside their own assumptions about the world in order to gain insight into users and their needs. The next stage is to synthesize the information created during the empathize stage and develop a concise statement of the problem. The problem should be defined in a human‑centered manner from the perspective of the user need. The Define stage will start the process to the next stage, the Ideate stage, to look for potential solutions. During the third stage of the Design Thinking process, designers are ready to start generating ideas. You've developed an understanding of your users and their needs in the Empathize stage, and you synthesize their observations in the Define stage and created a human‑centered problem statement. With this solid background, we can start to identify new solutions to the problem statement that you've created and start to look for alternative ways of viewing the problem. During the Prototype stage, the design team will produce some inexpensive prototypes to further investigate the potential solutions. The aim is to identify the best solution to the problem that satisfies the user need most effectively and most economically. During the Test stage, the design team will test the solution and gain user feedback. The results will often be used as an iterative process to either further define the problem or to better understand user needs. I want to emphasize once again that these stages don't necessarily take place sequentially, and the process might require going through these stages more than once to find an optimum solution.

## Notes
The five generally accepted stages of Design Thinking are as follows:

1. Empathize: This stage involves gaining a deep understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. It requires consulting experts, observing, engaging, and empathizing with people to understand their experiences and motivations. Immersing yourself in the physical environment can help you gain a deeper understanding of the issues involved. Empathy is crucial in this human-centered design process.

2. Define: In this stage, you synthesize the information collected during the empathize stage to develop a concise statement of the problem. The problem should be defined from the perspective of the user's needs, ensuring a human-centered focus. This problem statement will serve as the basis for the next stages.

3. Ideate: Once you've gained an understanding of your users and defined the problem, you can begin generating creative ideas. This stage involves brainstorming and looking for potential solutions to the problem statement you've created. It's about exploring alternative ways of approaching the problem.

4. Prototype: In the prototype stage, the design team creates inexpensive prototypes of potential solutions. These prototypes are used to investigate the solutions further, aiming to identify the best solution that effectively and economically satisfies the user's needs.

5. Test: The design team tests the solution and gathers user feedback in the test stage. The results of this testing often lead to an iterative process. The feedback may help refine the problem statement or provide a better understanding of user needs.

It's important to note that these stages do not always occur in a strict linear sequence. Design Thinking is a flexible and iterative process that may involve revisiting stages to find the most optimal solution.
