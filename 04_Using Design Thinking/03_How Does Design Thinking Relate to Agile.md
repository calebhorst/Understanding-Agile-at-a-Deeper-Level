## How Does Design Thinking Relate to Agile?
```
In this lesson, I want to talk about how does design thinking relate to agile? On the surface, it might look like design thinking is in conflict with agile. Design thinking encourages you to slow down and pay attention to all aspects of the design prior to jumping too quickly into a solution. If you tried to do it literally, it might mean following a set of stages sequentially, like waterfall. However, that's not necessarily really the intent. As I previously mentioned, the stages are meant to be conceptual. They are not meant to be followed exactly in a sequence, as it might look. The relationship between agile and design thinking is very similar to the relationship between agile and lean. Some people might see lean and agile as contradictory to each other. Lean tends to emphasize standardizing and streamlining processes to improve efficiency, while agile emphasizes flexibility and adaptivity to meet customer needs in a very uncertain environment. If each of those goals were pursued in isolation and to an extreme, they might in fact be somewhat in opposition to each other. However, if they are treated correctly and blended together in the right proportions, they can actually be very complementary to each other. The relationship to design thinking is similar. Agile emphasizes, reducing time to market and getting the development done as quickly as possible. Design thinking emphasizes considering all aspects of the design, particularly the human engineering aspects, and evaluating alternative solutions before you jump too quickly into a design. This is a slide I created originally for a discussion of agile and lean. It shows the balance that needs to be established between an agile approach and a lean approach. I've expanded it to include a balance between agile and design thinking. All of these things need to be considered in the right proportions in an agile development approach. An important point that you should get from this is that agile may require balancing conflicting forces. The common focus should be on maximizing customer value. The overall agile approach is not entirely inconsistent with design thinking. Agile is a flexible and adaptive approach to project management and development that emphasizes relying heavily on user feedback and inputs to optimize the value of the solution that you develop. While that aspect of an agile approach is very consistent with design thinking, it doesn't go as far as to emphasize the structured approach that design thinking advocates to understand the human needs behind project requirements. So that leaves open the question of how do you go about integrating agile and design thinking? Here are some general recommendations First, design thinking is not a methodology. It is a way of thinking, like lean and agile. It does not invalidate the basic agile/scrum methodology, and it isn't inconsistent if it's done in the right context. The most important aspect of design thinking is the philosophy behind it. Be sensitive to the human aspect of design. Don't just rush into a design from a technical development perceptive, and don't create a technically elegant design that may or may not be well designed from a human engineering perspective. Here are some more specific recommendations. Exactly how you might go about integrating design thinking with agile might vary from one project to the next. Agile is based on delivering value, and human engineering is only one component of value. There are different approaches that might be used, depending on the level of value placed on human engineering in the project. There are several different approaches that could be considered, depending on how critical design thinking is to the overall success of the project. In some projects, if the focus on human engineering is very critical, it may justify doing more upâ€‘front design prior to the start of the project to develop and test the overall design approach. Alternatively, a special sprint or a spike could be dedicated to finding an optimum design from a human engineering perspective. Another approach could be to incorporate a focus on design thinking directly into the design process for each sprint. Roman Pichler has suggested an approach for doing that that is shown in the diagram on this slide. If the focus on human engineering is less critical, another approach would be to just integrate the focus on human engineering into the design as a constraint that has to be met. It is essentially a risk of not providing an acceptable level of human engineering in the design

## Notes
The relationship between design thinking and agile is not one of conflict, but rather one of potential synergy. While design thinking and agile may appear to have different emphases, they can complement each other when used in the right proportions and contexts.

Design thinking encourages a more holistic and empathetic approach to design, emphasizing a deep understanding of user needs and human-centered solutions. It promotes considering all aspects of design before jumping into a solution. On the other hand, agile prioritizes flexibility, adaptability, and delivering value quickly.

To integrate design thinking with agile effectively, consider the following recommendations:

1. Recognize the Philosophy: Design thinking is a way of thinking and not a methodology. It emphasizes a human-centered approach to design. It doesn't invalidate agile methodologies but complements them.

2. Emphasize the Human Aspect: Be sensitive to the human engineering aspect of design. Avoid rushing into a design solely from a technical perspective. Prioritize well-designed, user-oriented solutions.

3. Adapt to the Context: The integration of design thinking with agile can vary based on the specific project's needs. The level of emphasis on human engineering in the project should guide the approach.

Approaches for integrating design thinking with agile include:

- Prioritizing Up-front Design: For projects where human engineering is crucial, you may justify dedicating time for up-front design work before the project starts. This can involve developing and testing the overall design approach.

- Special Sprint or Spike: Consider dedicating a specific sprint or spike to focus on finding an optimal design from a human engineering perspective.

- Integrated Design Thinking: Integrate design thinking directly into the design process for each sprint. This approach ensures that human-centered design is considered throughout the project's lifecycle.

- Design as a Constraint: In cases where human engineering is less critical, treat it as a constraint that the design must meet. This approach ensures that human-centered design considerations are included but without dedicating specific phases or sprints.

The goal is to find the right balance that suits your project's specific requirements, ensuring that user needs and human-centered design are integral to the agile development process.
