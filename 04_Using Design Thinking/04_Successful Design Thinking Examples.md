## Successful Design Thinking Examples
```
In this lesson, I want to talk about successful examples of design thinking. The first example is Apple Computer. Apple is one of the leading companies that is renowned for its unique products and brand. A short talk with an Apple user will reveal that there is an emotional relationship between consumers and Apple products, including every i product that was created in the past two decades. Why are Apple products different from their competitors' products? How does Apple manage to achieve innovation in its products families? Apple had a rough history for a while. In 1985 Steve Jobs was forced to leave the company. This marked the start of a very chaotic era in the company's strategy and product development. This slide shows some of the problems that Apple had during the period of 1985 through 1997. The company had a very unstable strategy due to the change of executive teams. There was unclear vision about Apple's competitive strategy. There was also unclear vision about selling operating system licences, which would put the company in competition with Windows operating systems. There was a large number of failed products, such as the Newton PDA, and few successful ones, such as the PowerBook. There were many products that were not unique in the market. And finally, there was lots of confusion and uncertainty among Apple consumers resulting from this strategy. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple after being fired, Apple's stock was selling for only $5 per share. One of the most important aspects of design thinking is an emphasis on human engineering. Here's a quote from Steve Jobs on that subject. "Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it's this veneer‑‑that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good.' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." Steve Jobs applied design thinking by focusing on people's needs and desires rather than only the needs of the business, building empathy by helping people to love Apple products. The design rather than the engineering work, designers considered both the form and the function of the product and building simple yet user‑friendly products rather than complex, hard‑to‑use products. The key difference is that although other competitors focus on the features and product capabilities, Apple focuses on a holistic user experience. This slide shows a summary of what was needed to be done to achieve this vision. The first area was excellence in execution. Steve improved the execution process by closing 2 divisions, eliminating 70% of the new products, and focusing only on the higher‑potential props, reducing the product lines from 15 to just 3, and shutting facilities to move manufacturing outside the company. Apple also launched a website for direct sale of its products and started to take an interest in materials and how products are manufactured with a consumer‑driven culture. The next area was the Apple platform strategy. Apple streamlined their product portfolio strategy to a family of products that can be produced much more quickly while keeping the existing design elements. Also, the company targeted products that required less repair and maintenance. A critical element of making this successful was iterative customer involvement. The consumer experience should be integrated into the design and development stages through participating in usability testing. Also, the design for interfaces should focus on the user experience. And finally, Apple wanted to create beautiful products. In addition to the function of the product, the form should be beautiful, which can be achieved through continuous innovation and development. Apple also focused on the materials and manufacturing process and took a bold approach to trying new ideas rather than sticking with the ordinary design forms. Can you imagine trying to do all of this with a traditional, plan‑driven approach to project management? It's clear to me that it would have been impossible. An agile approach was essential. Before we finish this lesson, I want to go over a few more examples of how design thinking is applied in other industries. The first additional company that I want to talk about is PepsiCo. PepsiCo is one of the world's leading food and beverage companies, serving more than 200 countries and territories around the world. They're well known for selling Pepsi canned soda and snacks such as Ruffles potato chips. You might not think that a company like this that sells such commodity products would benefit from design thinking. For example, a bag of potato chips is a bag of potato chips, isn't it? However, that's the very reason why design thinking can make a big difference in an industry like this, where there may be so little natural product differentiation. Pepsi is an example of a company that did a major corporate transformation based on applying design thinking to products as mundane as a can of soda pop. Just a few years ago, it wasn't clear whether Pepsi's CEO would survive. Many investors saw Pepsi as a bloated giant whose top brands were losing market share. The shelves seemed to be just more and more cluttered with competitive products, so Pepsi had to rethink their innovation process and design experiences for their customers, from conception to what's on the shelf. Now Pepsi teams are pushing design through the entire system, from product creation, to packaging and labeling, to how a product looks on the shelf, to how customers interact with it. A well‑designed product is one that you can fall in love with, or you hate. It may be polarizing, but it has to provide a real reaction. Ideally, it's a product that you want to engage with in the future, rather than just say I bought it and I consumed it. The lesson that we can learn from Pepsi is that commodity products as mundane as cans of soda pop can benefit from a lot of design thinking. Design thinking might need to permeate every aspect of the product, including how it is marketed and presented to customers in order to shift how people think about a product. The next example I want to talk about is GE Healthcare, which is known for MRI scanners, which can be terrifying experiences for children. If you've never had an MRI, I can tell you that it is a very frightening and difficult thing to do, even for an adult. You're typically strapped down to a sliding table in a very cold and unfriendly room and then pushed inside this relatively narrow tube for as long as 45 minutes while the machine makes all kinds of strange buzzing, clicking, and clacking noises while it tries to scan your body. And during that entire time you must be absolutely still. You can imagine what that experience might be like for a small child. Doug Dietz, who was a primary designer of the GE Healthcare MRI system, described the experience. "Everything in the room was kind of like, beige," he said, describing what he calls "crime scene" stickers (which tell patients where to go), and the exclamation mark warning sign on the door. "The room itself is kind of dark and has those flickering fluorescent lights." And he adds "that the machine that I had designed basically looked like a brick with a hole in it." The plan was simple: offer an environment that was so welcoming that children would feel like being scanned is an adventure and not a trial. To do so, they asked customers and children about what they would like during ideation sessions. This slide shows the results of that work. The next example I want to talk about is a very simple process change that was implemented by a chain of university hospitals to improve the way they handle patients in the emergency room. A trauma room in a major hospital can be a very chaotic place. When a patient with a gunshot wound or a motor vehicle accident arrives, a bed is prepped, the right supplies are on hand, and up to 20 nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians are ready to spring into action. "In a typical situation, a huddle of highly stressed emergency staff room members spoke over one another and there were no clear roles. In particular, no one knew who was leading the trauma code. One very simple innovation made a very big difference. The leader of the trauma team now wears an orange vest. The easy‑to‑spot garment, called the trauma team leader identification vest, clearly identifies who's in charge. It's a simple yet effective innovation created by a nurse after a very hectic gunshot trauma simulation." This situation illustrates the importance of supporting and utilizing innovative and novel ideas from all members of the health care team. Traditionally, hospitals were designed with input from administrators. With design thinking, the innovations come from those who actually work there, providing feedback to designers to improve the final product or service.

## Notes
These examples illustrate the successful application of design thinking in various industries, showcasing how it can lead to innovation, improve customer experiences, and transform traditional processes:

1. **Apple:** Apple's successful turnaround under Steve Jobs demonstrates the power of design thinking in product development. By focusing on human engineering, understanding user needs, simplifying product lines, and creating beautiful products, Apple built a strong emotional connection with its customers.

2. **PepsiCo:** Even in industries where products appear to be commodities, design thinking can make a significant impact. PepsiCo transformed its innovation process, rethinking how customers interact with products from conception to shelf. The emphasis was on creating well-designed, memorable experiences.

3. **GE Healthcare:** Design thinking was applied to improve the MRI experience, particularly for children. By involving customers and children in ideation sessions, GE Healthcare created a more welcoming and less intimidating environment for young patients undergoing MRI scans.

4. **University Hospitals' Trauma Room:** In a hospital setting, a simple design thinking approach—introducing an orange vest to identify the trauma team leader—improved the chaotic environment of trauma rooms. This change reduced confusion, improved communication, and ensured clear leadership during critical situations.

These examples highlight the versatility of design thinking in industries ranging from technology and food and beverage to healthcare. By focusing on empathy, human-centered design, and user experience, organizations can achieve significant improvements in their products, services, and processes. Design thinking encourages a shift from product-centric to customer-centric thinking, leading to innovative solutions and enhanced customer relationships.
