## Kanban Overview and Examples
```
Hi, and welcome to the next module in this course. In this module, we're going to discuss managing flow in Agile projects. One of the major differences between a traditional plan‑driven project and an Agile project is that a traditional plan‑driven project puts a lot of emphasis on managing the structure of the project with such things as work breakdown structures, PERT charts, Gantt charts, and so forth, while Agile projects put an emphasis on managing flow and efficiency rather than structure. Here's a brief summary of the topics in this module. First, we're going to provide an overview of a kanban process and how it works, as well as an example of a kanban application. Next, we're going to discuss kanban boards, which are very widely used in many Agile methodologies such as Scrum. Then we're going to discuss flow and the theory of constraints, which are important concepts from improving the performance of any agile process. And finally, we're going to discuss cumulative flow diagrams, which is a great tool for tracking and forecasting projects. In this session, we're going to talk about kanban, which is another widely used agile process in addition to Scrum. Where Scrum is used heavily for project and product development efforts that require some level of planning, kanban is generally more suited for continuous flow kinds of operations. However, the principles with flow and kanban are essential to Scrum. The origin of the word kanban is Japanese. It originated in the Toyota production system. Roughly translated, it means a card that you can see. Here's a simple example. Picture yourself on a Toyota production line. You put doors on Priuses. You have a stack of 10 or so doors. As you keep bolting them on, your stack of doors get shorter. When you get down to five doors, sitting on top of the fifth door in the stack is a card, a kanban card that says build 10 doors. Well, it may not say exactly that, but it is a request to build exactly 10 more Prius doors. You pick up the kanban card and you run it over to the guy who builds doors. He's been waiting for you. He's been doing other things to keep busy while waiting. The important thing here is that he's not been building Prius doors. He takes your kanban card and begins to build the doors. You go back to your workstation and just a bit before your stack of doors is gone, the door guy comes back with a stack of 10 doors. You know that kanban card is slid between doors five and six. You got the doors just in time. The kanban card is a tool to signal demand between stages in a process; however, the word kanban has taken on a much broader meaning than that in actual practice. To understand kanban, it is first necessary to understand the difference between a push system and a pull system. A push system is totally planned in advance. An example would be a traditional manufacturing process. It starts with a manufacturing plan based on a forecast of demand that someone thinks will take place. Raw materials are ordered and held in inventory waiting to go into production, and production resources are planned in advance and allocated to meet the forecasted demand in the manufacturing plant. In essence, raw materials are planned, and queued, and pushed through the manufacturing process. A traditional waterfall development process works on the same push principle. Requirements are forecast based on what someone thinks the customer needs, work is planned in advance, and resources are scheduled against the plan. A pull process, on the other hand, is totally demand driven and not planned. An example would be a manufacturing process where furniture is custom built to satisfy customer orders. In an ideal pull system, there is no plan and no work is scheduled until a customer order is received. Raw materials would be ordered only as needed to satisfy customer orders, and production resources would be allocated to work only as needed to satisfy customer orders. This is the inverse of a push process. In a pull process, customer orders are queued and raw materials are all pulled through the process to meet actual demand. All Agile processes are adaptive to customer demand to some extent, rather than being totally planned; however, a kanban process is based on pull and is totally unplanned and adaptive. Kanban is sometimes used as a software development process, but it is more often used in processes that are totally reactive and unplanned such as a customer service response system. In a customer service response system, some amount of capacity is planned to meet anticipated demand for support from customers, but those resources may be mostly idle until a customer calls with a problem. Scrum is far more widely used than kanban as a software development process. Scrum is actually a hybrid process involving both push and pull. In a Scrum process, work is planned to some extent in the product backlog, and it is broken up into sprints and releases. Within a sprint, the work is planned and allocated to the team; however, the whole sprint is demand driven based on priorities set by the product owner, and the product owner has considerable ability to influence what is built. A kanban process is more of a totally adaptive continuous flow model. No attempt is made to plan requirements in advance. The development process operates continuously and isn't broken up into sprints at all, and work is taken into the process immediately as soon as resources are available to work on it. An example would be a customer service response queue where you have some number of customer service agents who are trained to respond to customer support, telephone calls, and provide support. In that situation, it is totally demand driven by customers calling in, and it is also not heavily planned because the nature of the calls can vary significantly from one call to the next. There's a general level of planning to provide a reasonable level of capacity to handle an expected volume of support calls and at least some general level of training to the agents to handle typical support calls, but it is impossible to completely plan all aspects of the process. By its very nature, the process has to be highly reactive and very adaptive. A critical concept in kanban systems is the idea of work in process, or WIP. Kanban processes many times have stages that work goes through. An example is the customer service system designed to solve customer problems. A kanban system is designed to optimize the overall flow through the system, and each stage in the process might have capacity limitations that limit the overall work in process. For example, in a typical customer service response system, there's many times an initial level that you go through that is designed to screen calls and weed out problems that can be easily resolved without requiring more sophisticated resources. And problems that can't be resolved in that stage are routed onto a second or third level of support for further resolution, depending on the complexity and difficulty of the problem. The overall process is designed to optimize flow, and any individual stage in the process might have capacity limitations to limit the overall work and process or flow. When that happens, work waiting to enter the process simply piles up waiting to be done. In this situation, the size of the screening staff would typically be much larger than the more sophisticated problem resolution staff to optimize the flow and efficiency of the overall process. Each stage has a work in process limitation based on the capacity of the resources in that stage, and the flow through the process will be determined by which stage in the process is more limiting on the overall flow. For example, if the size of the level 1 staff is inadequate to handle incoming support calls, customers might wind up waiting in a phone queue for support. If the size of the level 2 staff is limited, more difficult problems might take much longer to resolve while customers wait for level 2 resources. Next, we're going to discuss a few examples of how a kanban process is used in the real world. There are some people who advocate using kanban rather than Scrum as an Agile product development process. And there are some situations where that makes sense. Here are a few examples. The first is a development process that is totally demand driven. An example I have seen is that a group is assigned to produce business reports on demand for users. In that situation, user requests would go into a queue of requests to create reports based on priority, and people would pull items to work on out of that queue whenever resources are available to work on them. The second example is a situation where product has reached a mature stage in its lifecycle that calls for mostly maintenance of adding some additional features and doing bug fixes. Those are the kinds of things that don't necessarily have to be planned. Some amount of capacity is planned to work on those things, and the items to be worked on are prioritized in a queue similar to the previous situation. The last situation is less typical. You could have a product development effort where planning is not essential, and it is desirable to get the work done as quickly as possible. In this kind of situation, a kanban process might be more streamlined and more efficient, but, of course, the caveat is that it is totally unplanned. That might be appropriate for small development projects, but would be difficult for it to apply to large critical projects. An example would be the situation I previously mentioned of producing reports. Producing an individual report is not typically a very complex effort and normally does not require a lot of planning. And finally, it's important to note that kanban is actually a foundation for Scrum. Within a sprint in Scrum, a kanban process is used to manage the flow of the work in process. For example, as this diagram shows, the work in progress in a sprint flows through stages, and a kanban board is often used to track the flow of work through the different stages.

## Notes
Kanban is an agile process that emphasizes managing flow and is particularly well-suited for continuous and adaptive operations. It originates from the Toyota production system and focuses on the pull system of demand-driven work. In a pull system, work is initiated based on actual demand, and resources are allocated to meet that demand as needed, rather than being planned in advance.

Here are some key points to understand about kanban:

1. **Pull System:** Kanban operates on the principles of a pull system, where work is initiated in response to customer demand. It contrasts with a push system, which is planned in advance based on forecasts.

2. **Continuous Flow:** Kanban is ideal for continuous and adaptive operations, such as customer service response systems, where work is continually pulled into the process as resources become available.

3. **Work in Process (WIP) Limits:** Kanban processes often have stages through which work flows. Each stage may have capacity limitations, and the overall flow through the system is determined by the stage with the most significant limitations on work in process.

4. **Real-World Examples:** Kanban can be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as demand-driven development processes, mature product maintenance, or small, streamlined development projects where planning is not essential.

5. **Complementary to Scrum:** Kanban is not limited to software development but can also be used within Scrum. In Scrum, a kanban process is employed to manage the flow of work within a sprint.

Kanban emphasizes adaptability and responding to actual demand, making it an effective approach in scenarios where planning can be less structured or where continuous flow is crucial. It can serve as a foundation for efficient work management, whether applied on its own or within a broader agile methodology.
