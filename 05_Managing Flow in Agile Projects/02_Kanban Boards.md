## Kanban Boards
```
The next subject I want to talk about is Kanban boards. Kanban boards are a very widely used tool in many agile methodologies, including scrum. Kanban boards are widely used in scrum to visually show the flow of items through a Kanban process in a sprint. The Kanban board can be as simple as a whiteboard with stickies on it, or 3 x 5 cards on it, that are manually moved around the board to show progress through the flow. The example shown here shows a simple Kanban board as it might be used in scrum. The columns in a Kanban board represent the stages in the Kanban process. For example, in this particular instance, the first column titled Next represents work items waiting to enter the process. The next column titled Analysis represents work items requiring further analysis before they go into development. The middle column titled Development represents work items that are currently in the development process. And finally, the last two items represent work items that are in acceptance testing and work items that have been released to production. Using stickies or 3 x 5 cards on Kanban boards has been widely used by small, individual scrum teams. In this approach, a whiteboard is dedicated to keeping track of work in progress, and individual work items are represented by colored sticky notes that are manually moved around the board as their status changes. The colors of the notes might signify different types of work or different priorities. Using stickies or 3 x 5 cards has its limitations. First, the data on the board is not updated automatically as progress is made. Updates to the status of items on the board are generally made once a day during a daily standâ€‘up meeting. And second, it doesn't work well for distributed teams that are not colocated, because all the people on the team do not have direct access to the board. It also doesn't provide a management reporting tool. Anyone who wants to know the status of work in progress has to go and look at the Kanban board. Most online tools that are designed to support agile projects provide a capability for Kanban boards. The version shown here was generated by an online electronic tool. This approach solves many of the problems of the informal whiteboard approach using stickies or 3 x 5 cards. The online tool has a number of advantages. The data can be automatically updated in real time as the work is being done, anyone can have direct access to either view or update the information locally or remotely, and the information on the board can automatically feed reporting tools such as burn down charts, and could be summarized and rolled up at any level for management reporting.

## Notes
Kanban boards are an essential tool in many Agile methodologies, including Scrum, for visually tracking the flow of work items through a Kanban process. These boards are designed to provide a clear representation of work in progress and help teams manage their tasks efficiently. Here are some key points to understand about Kanban boards:

1. **Representation of Workflow:** Kanban boards visually represent the workflow of a Kanban process. The columns on the board typically correspond to the various stages or states that work items go through during their lifecycle. These stages can vary depending on the specific process.

2. **Work Items:** Work items are represented as cards or sticky notes on the board. Each card usually corresponds to a specific task, user story, or work item that the team needs to complete.

3. **Movement of Cards:** The cards are manually moved from one column to the next as the work progresses through the stages. This visual movement reflects the real-time status of work items, making it easy for the team to see what needs attention and what is in progress.

4. **Status and Progress Tracking:** Kanban boards provide a clear way to track the status and progress of work items. Team members can quickly identify which tasks are in the queue, which are being analyzed, which are under development, which are in testing, and which have been completed.

5. **Customization:** Kanban boards can be customized to fit the specific workflow of a team or project. The number and names of columns, as well as any relevant details, can be adjusted to suit the process.

6. **Online Tools:** While physical boards with sticky notes are commonly used for small teams, online tools have become increasingly popular for larger teams or distributed teams. Online Kanban boards offer real-time updates, accessibility for remote team members, and integration with other reporting tools.

7. **Management Reporting:** Kanban boards, especially those integrated with online tools, can provide valuable data for management reporting. Metrics such as cycle time, lead time, and work in progress limits can be tracked and analyzed to improve workflow and efficiency.

Kanban boards are a powerful visual tool for managing work and promoting transparency within Agile teams. They enable teams to streamline their processes, track progress, and respond quickly to changes in work priorities. Whether using a physical board with sticky notes or an online tool, Kanban boards are a valuable resource for Agile practitioners.
