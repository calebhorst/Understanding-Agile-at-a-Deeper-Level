## Principles of Product Development Flow
```
In this session, we're going to talk about the principles of product development flow, based on Don Reinertsen's book, which are very important considerations that are needed to optimize the flow of any agile project. One of the major differences between an agile project and a traditional plan‑driven project is that an agile project focuses much more heavily on optimizing flow, where a traditional plan‑driven project focuses very heavily on the structure of the project, with models such as Gantt charts, PERT charts, work breakdown structures, etc. That's why it's so important to understand how to optimize flow in an agile project. In an agile project, there's normally not enough information available up front to develop elaborate Gantt charts or other structural project tools, and by organizing a project around high‑performance, self‑organizing teams, the structure of the project is considerably simplified. As a result, the structure of the project is not as important. In simple terms, you can think of an agile project as a big pipe, and the goal is to try to push as much stuff through the pipe as quickly as you can. That's why the concept of flow is so important. The most well‑known book on this subject is The Principles of Product Development Flow, by Don Reinertsen. In his book, he identifies seven principles of product development flow. Here's a brief explanation of how to apply these principles to optimize the flow in an agile project. The first principle is take an economic view. An agile project is based on maximizing value, and as a result, a key goal should be to deliver the highest‑value items as quickly as possible. This is done by prioritizing the items in the product backlog by highest business value first and deferring items of lower value. Another aspect of this principle is a recognition of the point of diminishing returns. Produce the simplest product you can, or what is called the minimum viable product, and then enhance it only as needed. Many traditional projects have gotten bogged down because users tend to ask for everything that they think they could possibly want, because they think that if they don't get it into the requirements they'll never get it at all. That's one of the big advantages of an agile project. By prioritizing requirements and working in a collaborative partnership, the users can say at some point that the project has gone far enough and needs to go no further. The next principle is actively manage queues. One of the important principles of optimizing the overall flow through a process is minimizing waste that occurs by having too many items in a queue waiting to be worked on. In a traditional plan‑driven project, you might have a large number of detailed requirements waiting to be worked on up front. Developing requirements that sit in a queue far in advance waiting for development has a number of disadvantages. The requirements might change prior to going into development, and much of the effort involved in developing the requirements might have been wasted and/or speculation in the requirements that is done too far into the future can result in erroneous assumptions that make their way into development without being questioned. The next two principles are very closely related in regard to batch size and variability. Large batch sizes tend to cause bottlenecks and inhibit flow. Imagine trying to push a large number of balls through a pipe. As you can imagine, that process would work better if you had a large number of small balls like ping‑pong balls rather than a smaller number of larger balls like basketballs. The basketballs would tend to get jammed up in the pipe, while the small ping‑pong balls would be much more likely to flow smoothly through the pipe. A related principle with regard to variability is that breaking up requirements into smaller ones that are of more uniform size reduces variability and can improve flow. For that reason, agile processes typically break up requirements into the smallest possible increment, such as a user story, in attempt to keep the requirements to a similar size to improve the ability to estimate and manage the flow of requirements through the process. Another important principle with kanban processes is the idea of work‑in‑process constraints, or WIP. As we discussed in any kanban process having multiple stages, there will always be some amount of imbalance between the stages, and one stage may have more capacity than a previous stage. For example, in a development process, there may be more capacity for doing development than there is for testing, and the output of the development effort could easily overload the testing capacity if it isn't controlled. Another example could be the use of shared, specialized resources in a project that are outside of the project team, such as a high‑level database architect. These resources should be used wisely to maximize their impact on the overall flow. The next principle is control flow under uncertainty through cadence and synchronization. Having a repeatable cadence improves the efficiency of the product development process and allows synchronizing a predictable development process with a much more unpredictable flow of requirements. In an agile project, a cadence is established by using fixed‑length sprints, which are timeboxed to a certain length. Instead of expanding the length of the sprint to accommodate a larger amount of work, keeping the sprints at a uniform length and limiting the work to be included in the sprint to the capacity of the sprint makes a flow of work much more uniform and predictable. The next principle is related to fast feedback. Taking corrective action quickly to adjust for problems and inefficiencies is absolutely essential to optimize the flow in a process. That's a key reason why sprints are kept a short as possible, typically two weeks. It enables rapid learning to make adjustments in the process to optimize the flow very quickly instead of letting problems compound themselves. And the final principle is related to decentralized control. Decentralizing control can enable much more rapid and more efficient decision making. In an agile project, this is done by empowering the people on the team as much as possible to plan and manage their own work and to make important decisions quickly as an empowered team.

## Notes
The principles of product development flow, as outlined by Don Reinertsen in his book "The Principles of Product Development Flow," provide valuable insights for optimizing the flow of work in agile projects. These principles offer a comprehensive framework for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of product development processes. Let's summarize these principles and their application in agile projects:

1. **Take an Economic View:**
   - Prioritize work items by business value to deliver high-value items first.
   - Recognize the point of diminishing returns and aim for a minimum viable product (MVP).
   - Collaboratively decide when the project has reached its goal.

2. **Actively Manage Queues:**
   - Reduce waste by minimizing the number of items in a queue.
   - Avoid having too many requirements or work items waiting for development.
   - Emphasize continuous flow and reduce waiting time.

3. **Understand and Reduce Batch Size:**
   - Large batch sizes can lead to bottlenecks and impede flow.
   - Smaller, uniform batch sizes help improve flow and predictability.
   - Agile processes often break requirements into smaller, uniform user stories for better management.

4. **Manage Variability:**
   - Reducing variability in requirements and work items can improve predictability.
   - Consistent, smaller requirements are easier to estimate and manage.
   - Reducing variability in flow through the process enhances overall efficiency.

5. **Control Work-in-Process (WIP) Constraints:**
   - Recognize and manage differences in capacity between process stages.
   - Prevent overloading downstream stages by controlling the flow of work.
   - Utilize specialized resources wisely to maximize their impact.

6. **Control Flow Under Uncertainty Through Cadence and Synchronization:**
   - Establish a predictable development cadence (e.g., sprints) to improve efficiency.
   - Timebox development work into regular cycles for synchronization.
   - Ensure that sprints are of fixed length and adjust work to fit the sprint's capacity.

7. **Use Fast Feedback:**
   - Emphasize quick feedback to make timely adjustments.
   - Rapidly identify problems and inefficiencies to optimize the flow.
   - Short sprint cycles and regular inspections facilitate fast feedback.

8. **Decentralized Control:**
   - Empower self-organizing teams to make decisions.
   - Enable teams to plan and manage their work.
   - Decentralized control accelerates decision-making and enhances efficiency.

These principles highlight the importance of continuous improvement, efficient resource utilization, and reducing waste in product development processes. Agile methodologies align well with these principles as they promote adaptability, transparency, and iterative development. By applying these principles, agile teams can achieve greater efficiency, predictability, and value delivery, ultimately optimizing the flow of work throughout the project.
