## Cumulative Flow Diagrams
```
In this section of the course, we're going to talk about cumulative flow diagrams, which is a very useful tool for visualizing process flow problems. Before we get into what a cumulative flow diagram is, we first need to understand a couple of other commonly used agile measurement tools. The first is a burn down chart. A burn down chart shows the overall rate of completing work over a period of time. It has two axes. The Y‑axis is the planned work to be completed in a given period of time, which typically would be measured in story points or hours. The X‑axis shows the planned amount of time allotted to complete the work, and that could be a sprint, a release, or an entire project. For example, a burn down chart is widely used in scrum to track the work completed in a scrum sprint. The burn down chart assumes that on the average work is completed linearly over the planned period of time. So the planned work to be completed is simply a diagonal line running from the total amount of work to be completed at the beginning of the time period on the Y‑axis to 0 at the end of the time period on the X‑axis. That, of course, is an ideal model, and work doesn't always get completed exactly as planned. The red line in this diagram shows the actual work remaining to be completed. When the actual work remaining to be completed, shown in the red line, is above the planned work to be completed, shown in the blue line, progress is slower than planned. And the opposite is true if the work remaining to be completed is below the blue line. The next item to understand is a burn up chart. A burn up chart is very similar to a burn down chart, except that it is the inverse. The Y‑axis is still the planned work to be completed in a given period of time, which typically would be measured in story points or hours. However, instead of starting with the planned amount of work to be completed and working down to 0 as the work is completed, it starts with 0 and works up to the total amount of work completed at the end of the planned interval. The X‑axis still shows the planned amount of time allotted to complete the work, and that could be a sprint, a release, or an entire project. The burn up chart also assumes that on the average work is completed linearly over the planned period of time, so that the planned work to be completed is simply a diagonal line running from 0 at the beginning of the time period to the planned total amount of work to be completed at the end of the time period. One interesting aspect of a burn up chart is that it makes it easier to show a change in scope as shown here. That shouldn't happen in the middle of a sprint, but it can easily happen in the middle of a release or a project. Another difference is, instead of showing the work remaining to be completed as a red line, the burn up chart shows the actual work completed as a red line. The relationship is also the inverse of the burn down chart. If the actual work completed shown in the red line is above the planned work to be completed shown in the blue Line, progress is faster than planned. And the opposite is true if the work remaining to be completed is below the blue line. A burn down chart or a burn up chart is a great tool, but they both have a major limitation in that they only show the total amount of work completed or remaining to be completed, and they don't provide sufficient visibility into how the work is progressing in each stage of the process or where the bottlenecks might be. If you want to improve the process flow, you probably need more information to know what the problem or bottleneck is and what could be done to improve it. A cumulative flow diagram is similar to a burn up chart, but it provides much more detail. If we look at this diagram as an example, the bottom portion of the chart showing the items that have been deployed is similar to a burn up chart. It shows the completed work. However, the cumulative flow diagram goes beyond that and also shows the items of work that are in each stage of work at each given point in time. For example, in this diagram, there's a nice, smooth flow of work through all of the stages of work in the process. At each point in time, there are two items of work in Acceptance and two items of work in Development. This is what you would consider a normal cumulative flow diagram. The important point is that cumulative flow diagrams enable us to measure how efficiently we're delivering valuable working product to the customer and indicate where we need to focus our process improvement efforts. The value of cumulative flow diagrams really comes into play when there's a need for process improvement. Here's an example. Suppose your burn up chart looks something like this. This definitely indicates a somewhat abnormal situation, and it's fairly typical in the real world. What this burn up chart shows is that the work completed lagged way behind schedule for most of the time period, but somehow the team made a crash effort at the very end to meet the goal and came out on time. Although this effort completed successfully, it probably isn't a very efficient mode of operation to crash this amount of work at the very end of the time period. In addition to not being very efficient, teams that operate in this mode are not very predictable and reliable to produce consistent results. However, this burn up chart doesn't give you enough information for diagnosing where the bottlenecks are in this process and what can be done to improve the flow to make it more efficient and predictable. This diagram shows what an abnormal cumulative flow diagram might look like. What we see in this diagram is, instead of a nice, even and consistent flow of work through all stages of the process, there's a big spike in the middle of the process where there's a peak of 10 items in Development at one time, and the spike then gets transferred into Testing and Acceptance. It's easy to see how this mode of operation is less efficient than one in which there's a nice, even flow of work through the process. It is also prone to lower levels of quality because what happens in this process is that a large number of items are completed in Development at one time and then are transferred into Testing. Testing is then under pressure to completely test a very large number of items in a very short amount of time in order to complete the sprint successfully. With this information, we can then dig further into possible reasons why this problem is occurring and take corrective action to try to improve the process. For example, the root cause of this particular problem might be that development is delaying taking on new work and then taking on too much work at once in order to try to complete the work required for the sprint. A cumulative flow diagram provides a lot more information about what is going on in a process. Two of the most significant pieces of information are work in process, or WIP. The vertical extent of any area at any particular point in time shows the work in process in that stage of the process at that point in time. And next is cycle time. The horizontal extent of any area over a period of time shows the average cycle time required to process a given number of work items in that particular stage of the process. Cumulative flow diagrams require a lot of data. For that reason, they would be almost impossible to create manually. However, they can be created very easily if the team is using an online tool for agile project management. In the next and final module of the course, we're going to do an overall course summary.

## Notes
Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFDs) are indeed valuable tools for visualizing the flow and identifying potential process problems in Agile projects. They offer more detailed information than burn-down or burn-up charts, enabling teams to assess the flow efficiency and the status of work in various stages of the process. Let's summarize the key points regarding Cumulative Flow Diagrams:

1. **Overview of CFD:**
   - CFD is a graphical representation that tracks the work items through various stages of a process over time.
   - It provides a visual history of work in progress (WIP) in each stage and shows how work accumulates or flows through the process.

2. **Components of CFD:**
   - The chart typically consists of multiple areas representing different stages of work, such as Backlog, Development, Testing, Acceptance, etc.
   - The vertical extent of each area at a specific time indicates the WIP in that stage.
   - The horizontal extent of each area over a period represents the cycle time, showing the average time it takes to complete a work item in that stage.

3. **Interpreting CFD:**
   - A normal CFD usually shows a consistent and balanced flow of work across stages.
   - Abnormalities in the CFD, such as spikes or backlogs in certain stages, can indicate potential bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or disruptions in the process.
   - These abnormalities may lead to delayed work, lower predictability, and quality issues.

4. **Using CFD for Process Improvement:**
   - CFD helps teams identify bottlenecks and address process inefficiencies.
   - Teams can analyze the areas where work accumulates or piles up and take corrective actions to smoothen the flow.
   - By addressing bottlenecks, teams can work towards improving predictability, efficiency, and overall process performance.

5. **Data Requirements:**
   - CFDs require substantial data to be effective, making them suitable for online Agile project management tools that automatically capture and display this information.

In conclusion, Cumulative Flow Diagrams provide a more detailed view of work in progress and its movement through various stages, making them an essential tool for process analysis, optimization, and continuous improvement in Agile projects. They enable teams to address bottlenecks, improve predictability, and ensure smoother, more efficient workflows.
