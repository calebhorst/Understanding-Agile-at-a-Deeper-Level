## Overall Course Summary
```
In this final module, we're going to do a brief overall summary of the course. There are four key points that I want you to take away from this course. The first is that in order to be excellent in agile and develop truly high‑performance teams, you have to focus on the principles and values and not just the mechanics. The second is to recognize that there are stages of learning in agile, and no one ever becomes fully proficient. It is an ongoing journey of continuous learning. The third key point is that it's important to fit the approach to the project, rather than just force fitting a project to a canned, predefined approach, and it takes a lot more skill to do that. And finally, use systems thinking to better understand agile at a deeper level. We're going to discuss each of those points individually in this summary. The first point is to focus on the principles and values and not just the mechanics of how to do agile and scrum. It should be understood that the effective execution of an agile process requires highly trained people. If it is done correctly, it is not just a matter of mechanically following a process by the book. Scrum is meant to be an adaptive process, and that requires a fair amount of skill and judgement to know how to adapt it to fit a given project and business environment. It is also not meant to be a static process that never changes. Continuous improvement is essential as a project is in progress, and that also requires knowledge and skill to determine how to optimize the process to make it more effective. It is well known that the training given to most agile teams is very limited. You can become a fully qualified Certified Scrum Master, or CSM, by taking a short course that is only 2 days long. The result is often that many times people learn the mechanics of how to do scrum and wind up following the process rigidly by the book. It is ironic that that is exactly the opposite of what was intended in the Agile Manifesto. Achieving excellence in developing truly high‑performance agile teams requires a significant commitment to learning that goes well beyond the basic scrum practices and focuses on a deeper understanding of the principles and values behind both agile and scrum, as well as more broad‑based principles and values based on Lean and TQM. Second, it's important to recognize that there are multiple stages of learning that are needed to reach the level of a truly high‑performance team. There's a model from the martial arts that I think fits very well that shows three major stages of learning, shu, ha, and ri. In the shu stage, the student learns to do things more or less mechanically by the book, without significantly deviating from accepted rules and practices and without improvising any new techniques. This stage is equivalent to a new, inexperienced project manager following PMBOK or other accepted practices by the book without necessarily adapting those processes to fit the situation, or a freshly trained scrum master following basic agile practices by the book. In the ha stage, the student learns to understand the principles at a deeper level and learns how to improvise and break free from rigidly accepted practices. But it's important to go through the shu stage and gain mastery of the foundational principles before you start improvising. Finally, in the ri stage, the student gets to the highest level of mastery and is able to develop his or her own principles and practices as necessary. There's a logical progression of learning through these stages, and it takes time to make this progression. A very important point is that you have to learn the foundational principles before you can improvise. Improvisation without knowledge is just amateurish experimentation. The next key point is to fit the approach to the project. As we discussed in the agile versus waterfall course, many people make the mistake of attempting to force fit their projects and business environment to some kind of canned, predefined approach, and that can cause a lot of confusion and consternation because it doesn't often result in a good fit. A better solution is to fit the approach, or combination of approaches, to the project and to the business environment. That requires a lot more skill. It requires knowledge of a broader range of methodologies, both agile and plan driven, as well as a deeper knowledge of the principles behind those methodologies, and the systems thinking approach to visualize how it all fits together in a well‑integrated approach that is well aligned with the business environment that it is part of. Finally, it is critical to understand and develop a systems thinking approach in order to see agile and the business environment that it is part of at a deeper level. Systems thinking is a perspective of seeing and understand systems as wholes rather than as a collection of parts. A whole is a web of interconnections that creates emerging patterns. The key message is, don't just accept things at face value, and mechanically following a process without questioning why it is done that way and without determining if there's a better way to accomplish the same result. Thank you very much for taking the time to take this course. I hope that it has been helpful to you. I am very interested in all of my students, so please keep me informed of your progress in implementing these ideas, and let me know if I can help in any way. Thank you.
